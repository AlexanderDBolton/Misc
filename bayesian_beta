Bayesian inference is a statistical approach that allows us to update our beliefs about unknown parameters as we observe new data. It is based on Bayes' theorem, which describes how to update probabilities given new evidence. In Bayesian analysis, we start with a prior distribution representing our initial beliefs, combine it with observed data through a likelihood function, and obtain a posterior distribution that reflects our updated beliefs.
The beta distribution plays a crucial role in Bayesian inference, particularly when dealing with binary outcomes or proportions. It is a continuous probability distribution defined on the interval [0, 1] and is characterized by two shape parameters, α and β. The probability density function of the beta distribution is given by:

where B(α,β) is the beta function.
Key properties of the beta distribution include:
Flexibility: It can take various shapes depending on the values of α and β, including uniform, unimodal, and U-shaped distributions.
Conjugate prior: For binomial likelihood functions, the beta distribution serves as a conjugate prior, meaning the posterior distribution is also a beta distribution.
Modeling probabilities: It is well-suited for modeling random probabilities and proportions, making it valuable in Bayesian analysis.
Parameter interpretation: α can be interpreted as the number of successes plus 1, while β represents the number of failures plus 1 in a binomial experiment.
The beta distribution is particularly useful in Bayesian inference for updating beliefs about probabilities. For example, if we start with a prior beta distribution for the probability of success in a binary experiment, after observing new data, the posterior distribution will also be a beta distribution with updated parameters. This property makes the beta distribution a powerful tool for sequential updating of probabilities in Bayesian analysis.
