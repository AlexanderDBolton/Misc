### General Attribution Project Proposal

#### Objective
The goal of the attribution project is to establish a robust framework for measuring the impact of deployed projects, both for accurate pre-deployment value estimation and ongoing post-deployment value monitoring. By implementing this framework, we can systematically evaluate each project’s contribution to the company's key metrics, like revenue, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency. This attribution framework aims to (1) enable data-driven prioritization of new projects based on potential value, (2) provide an objective assessment of ongoing and completed projects, and (3) drive continuous improvement by identifying high-impact initiatives.

#### Approach
1. **Define Success Metrics**: For each project, establish specific success metrics that align with business objectives. For example, revenue generated, efficiency gains, or increased user engagement.
2. **Attribution Model Design**: Develop a flexible model that attributes observed outcomes (e.g., revenue increases) to specific projects based on historical data, predictive modeling, and counterfactual analysis (comparing with what would likely have happened without the project).
3. **Data Collection and Monitoring**: Set up an automated pipeline to gather relevant data for each project, ensuring that data is collected consistently across projects. Implement monitoring dashboards for real-time tracking of these metrics.
4. **Reporting and Feedback**: Generate reports with attribution insights and share them with relevant stakeholders. These reports should include an impact summary for each project and offer recommendations for adjustments or improvements.

### Applying the Attribution Framework

#### 1. **Project on Recommendations to Account Managers**
   - **Objective**: Provide account managers with actionable recommendations, such as which clients are likely to book soon, where upsell opportunities lie, or which clients may be at risk of churning.
   - **Attribution Approach**:
     - *Metrics*: Track the revenue generated from clients who interacted with account managers after receiving these recommendations. Additionally, monitor metrics such as client retention rates, upsell success rate, and booking frequency.
     - *Attribution Model*: Build a causal impact model that compares the outcomes for clients who received recommendations with a control group of similar clients who did not. This model could leverage techniques like difference-in-differences or propensity score matching to control for confounding factors.
     - *Monitoring*: Set up a dashboard showing KPIs (revenue from targeted clients, upsell success rate, retention changes) and compare to expected baselines.
     - *Reporting*: Provide monthly updates on impact and specific insights for optimizing recommendations, like refining targeting or recommendation timing.

#### 2. **Project on A/B Testing within the Company**
   - **Objective**: Enable teams to validate the impact of their initiatives by running experiments that compare new features or processes with existing ones.
   - **Attribution Approach**:
     - *Metrics*: For each A/B test, identify relevant KPIs (e.g., conversion rate, user engagement, operational efficiency) and define a baseline metric from the control group.
     - *Attribution Model*: Create a systematic framework to analyze A/B test results, emphasizing statistical rigor. Incorporate Bayesian analysis or bootstrapping techniques for more robust confidence intervals on small sample sizes. Build a process to check if the results are statistically significant and consistent across user segments.
     - *Monitoring*: Develop a centralized dashboard for tracking and summarizing all active A/B tests, with real-time visualization of KPI trends and confidence intervals.
     - *Reporting*: Deliver weekly or biweekly reports on the status and outcomes of A/B tests, and aggregate historical results to identify which types of changes tend to yield the most value.

#### 3. **Project to Value Projects' Value**
   - **Objective**: Create a repeatable methodology for valuing all projects across the company, both pre- and post-deployment, to inform prioritization and resource allocation.
   - **Attribution Approach**:
     - *Metrics*: Define a standard set of success metrics for each project type, like estimated incremental revenue, cost savings, user engagement, or customer satisfaction. For each project, establish the projected impact during planning and actual impact after deployment.
     - *Attribution Model*: Use regression-based attribution models or machine learning (ML) models to estimate the potential and realized value of each project. The model could include variables such as project scope, resource allocation, time to impact, and historical performance of similar projects.
     - *Monitoring*: Build a dashboard tracking the estimated vs. actual value of each project. Include data on metrics like actual vs. projected revenue, and timeline adherence, allowing management to quickly assess any project’s performance.
     - *Reporting*: Provide quarterly reports showing a portfolio-level view of all projects and individual project impact summaries. This report would highlight high-ROI projects, projects with significant gaps between expected and actual impact, and recommendations for future prioritization.

### Summary
This attribution framework not only helps in the rigorous pre-deployment estimation of project value but also continuously evaluates the realized value of projects, ensuring resource alignment and ROI maximization. The three specific applications demonstrate how this framework provides flexibility to adapt to different project needs while delivering consistent insights on their contributions.
